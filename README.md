# Python_ChebFun
Creating chebfun in python.

This project is part of a graduate level independent study at Texas Tech University within the Department of Mathematics and Statistics. 

The aim of the study is master the material covered in "Approximation Theory and Approximation Practice." The text makes heavy use of matlab and the chebfun package. For our purposes we will be using numpy and aim to rebuild the necessary parts of the chebfun package in Python.
