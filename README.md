# Python_ChebFun
This project is part of an independent study at Texas Tech University within the Department of Mathematics and Statistics. 

The aim of the study is to master the material covered in "Approximation Theory and Approximation Practice." The text makes heavy use of matlab and the chebfun package. For our purposes we intend to use numpy and recreate the neccessary parts of the chebfun package in python.
